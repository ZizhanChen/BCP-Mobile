This code is licensed under the MIT license.  If you're feeling like an adventurous leet hacker, make sure to submit a pull request.  I'm always open to suggestions and improvements, so feel free to let me know any features you'd like to see included. I'm currently busy in college so I won't have time to constantly maintain the app, but I'll check up on it from time to time.

Wishlist
============

Here's a small list of potential features to add to the app:

* Push notifications for changes in grade
* Home screen widget implementation

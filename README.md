### Update - September 6, 2014
Bellarmine has been developing its own "BCP Mobile" for Android and iOS, and as a result, we (Bryce and I) have no choice but to disable and remove [BCP Mobile for Android](https://github.com/richard1/BCP-Mobile) and [BCP Mobile for iOS](https://github.com/KingfishDevelopment/BCP-Mobile) from their respective app stores.  Thanks so much to all who installed and used the apps!  It's been a wonderful experience, and I sincerely hope you all had as much fun using the app as I had writing it.

Stay awesome, and **GO BELLS!**
